In this assessment I intended on caching images and routes for the product listing page and the product display page for everything in the "New Products" section of the webpage. I did this using Layer0. I also prefetched and deepfetched from routes on the PLP and PDP pages. If I had more time I'd implement more cache data and prefetches for common products and routes that the majority of users would be interested in and that are constant across all users. Layer0 had good documentation and was relatively straighforward to implement. The Layer0 dev tool helped keep things clean while giving you everything necessary to view the impact it makes.
